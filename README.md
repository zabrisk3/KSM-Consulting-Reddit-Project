Introduction

Posts of similar themes can be found in many different subreddits on Reddit’s website. One can, for example, find Star Wars-themed posts in a variety of subreddits, some of which are Star Wars-specific, some of which are not. With this in mind, the question arises of whether or not it is possible to determine the specific subreddit of a post, given the content of the post itself.  Such classification would have multiple useful applications for Reddit and other companies. 

First, it would allow Reddit to make subreddit recommendations to its users. For example, if someone’s Star Wars posts in a particular subreddit are similar in content to other users’ posts in another subreddit, then Reddit could advise that user to switch subreddits for a better experience. 

Second, it would assist Reddit in determining ways to advertise to current users. For example, if all of someone’s Star Wars-themed posts occurred in a specific subreddit, then Reddit might focus Star Wars advertising (for Star Wars-themed games, collectibles, movie tickets, etc.) within that subreddit.

Third, this method of classification assists Reddit and other companies in performing general market research. Beyond the realm of Star Wars-related content, being able to classify a Reddit post can lead into key insights into certain demographics. If, in the world of politics, Reddit posts could be classified to Republican or Democrat subreddits based on issues discussed within those posts, then this classification could be a way to determine which issues are most discussed (and in what way) amongst different political parties. A similar analysis could be made between different religions, or people from different countries, in determining what is most pertinent for their discussions on Reddit. And of course, this can be extended to other social media sites outside of Reddit, or other websites where user posts are common. 

This project will focus on the classification of Star Wars posts into two different subreddits: movies and Star Wars. It will do so by attempting to separate Reddit posts based on certain words in certain categories that could appear within Star Wars-themed posts. There are two main steps in this project. First, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach will be used to create a linear classifier for the data and determine the order of importance for categories of words in classification. Following this, rule mining will then be implemented, using the most important category of words, for further analysis.
